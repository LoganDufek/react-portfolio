## Challenge Twenty React Portfolio

### Description 

The challenge for this week was to use our React knowledge to update our existing portfolios from Week 2, which just used HTML and CSS. It was a fun project despite some hiccups here and there, getting the different React elements to communicate with one another using props was key and was satisfying when it worked. Likewise utilizing React's Router feature helped my simple resume still feel like a modern single page application. The organization of the different Components and Pages, and which made sense for which, was also something that became more clear through working on this challenge

There are some things that were left on the coding room floor due to time constraints but I look forward to being able to update this portfolio with more features and examples of my work as I progress in my programming career.
